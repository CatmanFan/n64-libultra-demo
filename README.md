Basic demo for Nintendo 64 homebrew using the proprietary official LibUltra SDK.

The code for this is partially based off of [non_nusys_demo](https://github.com/gamemasterplc/non_nusys_demo) by gamemasterplc and the [Mupen64Plus ROM](https://github.com/mupen64plus/mupen64plus-rom). It also requires the [Builder](https://github.com/buu342/N64-Platform64/tree/master/Tools/Builder) made by Buu342 (if you don't have a copy of the .exe, it is still possible to create a Makefile using the parameters in `builder.nbp` as a reference).

## Tools
* 3D models were converted using [Fast64](https://github.com/Fast-64/fast64).
